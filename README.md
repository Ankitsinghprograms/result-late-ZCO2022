# result-late-ZCO2022


## As expected ZCO-2022 results are not announced yet. 
 

## I made program to check whether result is announced or not in python 


# Task- I made code readability very bad. Pull request and try to make it even more worse.
 

# Follow these steps to use

### I am assuming you downloaded python

1. Copy code from zco2022.py and save in computer as  zco2022.py or blahblahblah.py

2. pip install requests (in terminal) 
 
3. Run code in Vscode/Terminal or anything 


# Note- Dont close terminal/vscode after running program. If program dont work run it again.
